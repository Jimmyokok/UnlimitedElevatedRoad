If you want anarchy around elevated road construction,this mod suits you. With this mod, you are able to construction elevated roads/bridges/intersections at ease, free from the annoying pillars/steepness/length restrictions, and even build a roller coaster of road!

## Feature

* Configurable pillar interval (20m-800m).
* Optional no pillar construction mode.
* Configurable maximum edge section length (20m-800m).
* Optional no height limitation construction mode, that lifts the height restriction to 1000m.
* Optional no steepness limitation construction mode.
* One-click options to restore vanilla/mod default settings.
* The above settings all appear in the game setting menu and are recommended to be configured in-game. The changes you've made **immediately take effect** and persist in the configuration file.
	
## Important Notes

* This mod affects save games, as the road/bridges/tracks you've built are just there.
* This mod is currently BETA and still needs more testing. FEEDBACKS are most welcomed(via Github issues).
* Setting the maximum edge length to extreme values would possibly cause weird behaviors, e.g. extremely difficult to delete a piece of road. Please be cautious when playing with the maximum edge length.
